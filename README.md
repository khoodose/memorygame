# Memory Game

Hi there.  This is my first project for the General Assembly WDI in Singapore.  I have chosen to do a memory game, partly because of my interest in recreating board games and strategy games, and partly because I have recent memories of having to play this in Escape Rooms with my friends.

### Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.
